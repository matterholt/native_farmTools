# Daily tool that a normal farm can use


## Story

I have been raising sheep and my family is in the dairy industry. There are a couple thing that would like to have handy to figure out some dates, weights or other information that can help with the farm.

## The Tools

1. Gestation calculator
   - project the lambing date for the flock
   - hit mile stones for a new born lamb

2. Auction Tracker
   - tracks the selling price animal that is sold at auction.

3. Pearson Square calculator
   - help figure out the what feed ratios for the dairy cows

4. Weight Estimator
   - with a couple measurements on a sheep body can estimate the weight

## Tech

- React Native with Expo
- few custom APIs with python
